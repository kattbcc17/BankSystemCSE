# BankSystem
# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal with this project is to deepen my understanding of C++ language features and the Standard Template Library (STL) by implementing a comprehensive bank system. This software demonstrates my proficiency in managing objects, using algorithms like for_each, remove_if, accumulate, and transform, and handling data structures such as lists. Through this project, I aim to refine my skills in object-oriented programming, algorithm design, and software testing.
